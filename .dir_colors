# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init

NORMAL 00	# global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00 	# normal file
DIR 01;34		# directory
LINK 36 	# symbolic link.  (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
           	# numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
FIFO 40;33	# pipe
SOCK 01;35	# socket
DOOR 01;35	# door
BLK 40;33;01	# block device driver
CHR 40;33;01 	# character device driver
ORPHAN 40;31;01 # symlink to nonexistent file
OTHER_WRITABLE 01;34 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky

# This is for files with execute permission:
EXEC 32

# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to colorize below. Put the extension, a space, and the color init string.
